                Hi, my name is Tanner! I'm currently a third year student at CU Boulder. I'm studying Computer and Electrical Engineering with a
                minor in Computer Science.
                I really enjoy my field of study, its been challenging, interesting, but most of all, fun. I've had the oppotunity to learn and develop
                skills in topics I never
                thought I'd be able to. Because of that, I've developed a passion for the field, esecially databases and data storage. In my free time,
                I like to 
                play video games, lift, cook, and work on personal projects. Currently, I'm working as an intern at MKS Instruments.

                This project is the definition of using engineering skills for dumb reasons. The idea of this project is to make a discord bot
                that takes in someone talking, then outputs what they are saying in morse code through sheeshes. It's called project Manhattan
                due to it being top secret to one of my roommates.

            This has been a project I've been working on in the backround. Usually during breaks from school. The goal of this project
            is to create a matrix of LEDs and then have them act as an audio visualizer for music. With my other audio visualizer using
            LEDs I used an arduino Uno, however for this project I'm considering using a raspberry pi instead to gain experience with that.

            This was a lab for my embedded software class. It involved writing drivers for SPI communication for one of the onboard sensors.
            To read and write from the sensor a state machine was used. This information was then processed within the application code and 
            caused the boards LED to turn green if it was upside down and off if it was rightside up. A message was also sent to a bluetooth
            module that told you which direction it was facing as well.
